# What is SED?

**SED** (Semantic Entropy Differencing) is a tool that uses **information theory** to measure and understand the semantic impact of code changes.

## The Problem

Traditional diff tools tell you *what* changed in your code, but not *how significant* those changes are. A one-line fix to a critical algorithm looks the same as adding a comment to a traditional diff.

This makes it hard to:

- **Prioritize code reviews** - Which PRs need the most attention?
- **Assess risk** - How likely is this change to introduce bugs?
- **Track complexity** - Is our codebase getting harder to maintain?

## The Solution

SED analyzes code changes at the **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) level** and calculates **entropy** - a measure of information content from information theory.

### How It Works

1. **Parse** source files into AST representations
2. **Diff** the ASTs to identify structural changes
3. **Calculate** entropy for each change based on its semantic impact
4. **Classify** changes into categories: trivial, low, medium, high, critical

### Entropy Explained

In information theory, **entropy** measures the amount of information or "surprise" in a message. Applied to code:

| Change Type | Entropy | Why |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Whitespace/formatting | Very Low | No semantic change |
| Rename variable | Low | Same structure, different label |
| Modify expression | Medium | Changes behavior locally |
| Add function | High | New capability/complexity |
| Rewrite algorithm | Very High | Fundamental logic change |

## Key Features

### Multi-Platform Support

- **CLI** - Fast command-line analysis for scripts and automation
- **VS Code Extension** - Integrated analysis while you code
- **GitHub Action** - Automated PR analysis and quality gates
- **Web Dashboard** - Visual exploration and reporting

### Language Support

SED supports many programming languages:

- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- Java
- And more...

### Smart Classification

Changes are automatically classified based on entropy thresholds:

```
Classification | Entropy Range | Typical Changes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trivial        | 0.0 - 0.5     | Formatting, comments
Low            | 0.5 - 1.5     | Renames, simple fixes
Medium         | 1.5 - 3.0     | Logic modifications
High           | 3.0 - 4.5     | New features, refactors
Critical       | 4.5+          | Architectural changes
```

## Use Cases

### Code Review Prioritization

Focus review time on high-entropy changes that are most likely to contain bugs or require careful consideration.

### CI/CD Quality Gates

Set up automated checks that fail builds when entropy exceeds thresholds, preventing accidental complexity increases.

### Technical Debt Tracking

Monitor entropy trends over time to identify areas of the codebase that are becoming increasingly complex.

### Documentation

Use entropy analysis to identify which changes warrant documentation updates or changelog entries.

## Architecture

SED is built as a **monorepo** with multiple packages:

```
